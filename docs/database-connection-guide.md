# Complete Database Connection Guide

## Overview
This guide ensures your CRM system is fully connected to the Supabase database with all real data functionality working properly.

## Current Status âœ…
Your CRM system is already configured with Supabase! The environment variables are set and the connection is established. Now we need to ensure all database tables and functions are properly set up.

## Step 1: Verify Environment Variables

Check that these are set in your `.env` file:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

## Step 2: Run Database Setup Script

Execute this script in your Supabase SQL Editor to create all necessary tables and functions:

**File**: `scripts/verify-database-connection.sql`

This script will:
- âœ… Create all required tables (students, classes, fee_receipts, fee_reminders)
- âœ… Set up proper indexes for performance
- âœ… Enable Row Level Security (RLS) with appropriate policies
- âœ… Create database functions for fee reminders
- âœ… Insert default class data
- âœ… Set up triggers for automatic timestamp updates

## Step 3: Test Database Connection

Use the built-in Database Connection Test:

1. Navigate to `/setup` page in your CRM
2. Click "Run Database Tests"
3. Verify all components show green checkmarks:
   - âœ… Database Connection
   - âœ… Students Table
   - âœ… Classes Table  
   - âœ… Fee Receipts Table
   - âœ… Fee Reminders Table
   - âœ… Database Functions
   - âœ… CRUD Operations

## Step 4: Verify Real Data Functionality

### Students Management
- **Add Student**: Go to `/students` â†’ "Add Student" â†’ Fill form â†’ Save
- **Edit Student**: Click edit icon on any student â†’ Modify data â†’ Save
- **Delete Student**: Click delete icon â†’ Confirm deletion
- **View Students**: All data should come from database, not dummy data

### Fee Receipts
- **Create Receipt**: Go to `/receipts` â†’ "Create Receipt" â†’ Select student â†’ Enter payment details â†’ Save
- **View Receipts**: All receipts should display real data from database
- **Edit Receipt**: Modify existing receipts and verify changes persist
- **Receipt Numbers**: Should auto-generate (RCP-0001, RCP-0002, etc.)

### Classes Management
- **View Classes**: Should show default classes (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) with proper fee amounts
- **Add Classes**: Create new classes with custom fee amounts
- **Edit Classes**: Modify existing class information

### Analytics & Reports
- **Dashboard**: Should show real counts and statistics from database
- **Analytics Page**: Charts and metrics should reflect actual data
- **Fee Analytics**: If flexible fee structure is enabled, shows discount analysis

### Fee Reminders
- **Overdue Detection**: System should find students with fees 30+ days overdue
- **WhatsApp Integration**: Generate and send reminder messages
- **Reminder Tracking**: Log all reminder activities in database

## Step 5: Database Tables Structure

### Core Tables Created:

#### `students`
- Student information, contact details, fee amounts
- Supports flexible fee structure with discount tracking

#### `classes`
- Class definitions with standard fee amounts
- Used as reference pricing for students

#### `fee_receipts`
- Payment records with amounts and dates
- Tracks remaining balances for overdue calculations

#### `fee_reminders`
- Reminder history and tracking
- Supports automated follow-up scheduling

## Step 6: Database Functions Available

### `get_overdue_payments(grace_period_days)`
- Finds students with overdue payments
- Calculates days overdue based on 30-day grace period
- Returns complete student and payment information

### `generate_receipt_number()`
- Auto-generates sequential receipt numbers
- Format: RCP-0001, RCP-0002, etc.

### `update_updated_at_column()`
- Automatically updates timestamp fields
- Triggered on record modifications
