The CRM now supports flexible fee negotiations while maintaining fixed class pricing as reference. This allows administrators to offer discounts and custom pricing while tracking the financial impact.

## Features Implemented

  - `discount_percentage` - Calculated discount percentage

### ‚úÖ **Student Registration**
- **Final Fee Amount Field**: Enter the negotiated fee during student registration
- **Real-time Discount Calculation**: Shows discount amount and percentage as you type
- **Reference Pricing**: Displays the standard class fee for comparison
- **Visual Indicators**: Green for discounts, blue for premium pricing

### ‚úÖ **Fee Receipt Generation**
- **Uses Final Fee Amount**: All receipts are generated based on the student's negotiated fee
- **Automatic Calculation**: Total fee, paid amount, and remaining due use the final fee amount
- **Accurate Tracking**: Ensures financial records reflect actual negotiated amounts

### ‚úÖ **Fee Reminders System**
- **Final Fee Based**: All overdue calculations use the student's final fee amount
- **Accurate Reminders**: Messages show the correct negotiated amount owed
