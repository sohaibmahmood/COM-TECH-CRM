# Fixes Applied to CRM System

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Removed Notifications from Settings
**Issue**: Remove notification settings from the settings page
**Fix**: 
- Removed the entire "Notifications Settings" card from `app/settings/page.tsx`
- Removed the BellIcon component that was only used for notifications
- Settings page now only shows Appearance and System Information sections

### 2. ✅ Fixed System Theme Not Working
**Issue**: System theme option wasn't responding to OS theme changes
**Fix**: 
- Updated `components/theme-provider.tsx` to listen for system theme changes
- Added MediaQueryListEvent listener for `(prefers-color-scheme: dark)`
- System theme now automatically switches when OS theme changes

### 3. ✅ Fixed Currency Symbol in Import-Export
**Issue**: ₹ symbol was showing instead of PKR in Available Classes section
**Fix**: 
- Updated `components/import-export-tabs.tsx` line 504
- Changed `₹{cls.fee_amount.toLocaleString()}` to `PKR {cls.fee_amount.toLocaleString()}`
- Now consistently shows PKR currency format

### 4. ✅ Fixed Fee Reminder Logic (30-Day Rule)
**Issue**: Reminder system was using incorrect logic for overdue calculation
**Previous Logic**: `payment_date + 1 month + 30 days` (60 days total)
**New Logic**: `payment_date + 30 days` (30 days total)

**Files Updated**:
- `scripts/003_fee_reminders_schema.sql` - Updated get_overdue_payments function
- `scripts/004_fix_reminder_logic.sql` - Migration script to fix existing database
- Updated days_overdue calculation in schedule_next_reminder function

**How it works now**:
1. Student makes payment on `payment_date`
2. Fee becomes overdue after 30 days from `payment_date`
3. Reminder system detects overdue payments and allows sending reminders
4. Days overdue = Current Date - (Payment Date + 30 days)

## Database Setup Required

To apply the fee reminder fixes, run these SQL scripts in order:

```sql
-- 1. Create the fee reminders system (if not already done)
\i scripts/003_fee_reminders_schema.sql

-- 2. Apply the 30-day logic fix
\i scripts/004_fix_reminder_logic.sql
```

## Testing the Fixes

### 1. Settings Page
- Navigate to `/settings`
- Verify notifications section is removed
- Test theme switching (Light/Dark/System)
- Change OS theme and verify System option follows it

### 2. Import-Export Page
- Navigate to `/import-export`
- Check "Available Classes" section
- Verify all amounts show "PKR" instead of "₹"

### 3. Fee Reminders
- Navigate to `/fee-reminders`
- Check if overdue students are displayed
- Verify the 30-day logic:
  - Students with payments older than 30 days should appear
  - Days overdue should be calculated from payment_date + 30 days

## Fee Reminder Logic Explanation

### Before Fix:
```
Payment Date: 2024-01-01
Due Date: 2024-02-01 (payment_date + 1 month)
Reminder Trigger: 2024-03-02 (due_date + 30 days grace)
Total Wait: 60 days
```

### After Fix:
```
Payment Date: 2024-01-01
Reminder Trigger: 2024-01-31 (payment_date + 30 days)
Total Wait: 30 days
```

### Urgency Levels:
- **Gentle (1-7 days overdue)**: "Your fees payment is pending"
- **Moderate (8-30 days overdue)**: "Payment is now overdue and requires attention"
- **Urgent (30+ days overdue)**: "URGENT Payment Notice - enrollment may be suspended"

## Verification Commands

After running the database scripts, you can verify the fixes:

```sql
-- Check if functions exist
SELECT routine_name 
FROM information_schema.routines 
WHERE routine_name IN ('get_overdue_payments', 'generate_reminder_message', 'schedule_next_reminder');

-- Test the 30-day logic
SELECT 
  student_name,
  payment_date,
  remaining_due,
  days_overdue,
  CASE 
    WHEN days_overdue <= 7 THEN 'Gentle'
    WHEN days_overdue <= 30 THEN 'Moderate' 
    ELSE 'Urgent'
  END as urgency_level
FROM get_overdue_payments(30)
ORDER BY days_overdue DESC;

-- Check current overdue count
SELECT COUNT(*) as overdue_students FROM get_overdue_payments(30);
```

## Next Steps

1. **Run Database Migrations**: Execute the SQL scripts to update the database functions
2. **Test Fee Reminders**: Navigate to `/fee-reminders` and verify data loads correctly
3. **Test Reminder Sending**: Try sending a test reminder via WhatsApp
4. **Verify 30-Day Logic**: Check that only students with fees 30+ days old appear

All fixes have been applied to the codebase and are ready for testing!
